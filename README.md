## Brief description of your green agent and what it orchestrates

The green agent orchestrates a set of user query with necessery document attachment to an assistant for obtaining results for user queries. After the orchestration, it uses text match evaluation method to score each corresponding response with ground truth.

## How scoring/evaluation works

Responses consistent with the ground truth are deemed correct.

## Any configurable parameters (like task specification)
A general asistant can be configured to response user query with ability to handle files.

## Requirements for participant agents
Your A2A agents must respond to natural language requests with direct, clear response.
